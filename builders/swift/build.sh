# Ratatoskr — stage-2 Swift (shen-swift) builder.
#
#   builders/swift/build.sh <shaken-dir> <out-dir>
#
# <shaken-dir> is a (ratatoskr.shake ...) output (kernel.kl + user .kl +
# ratatoskr.manifest). Produces a self-contained artifact at <out-dir>: the
# shaken kernel + user slice plus a `run` launcher that drives the shen-swift
# tree-walking interpreter in `--shaken` mode (boot the minimal slice instead
# of the full 19-file kernel, then run the program to completion).
#
# Unlike the compiled targets (lisp/go/rust/scheme), shen-swift is an
# INTERPRETER, so there is nothing to code-generate: the artifact is the KL
# slice itself, executed by the shen-swift binary — the same relationship the
# lua/julia targets have to their runtimes. The win is boot speed: a ~200-line
# shaken kernel vs the full ~2500-line kernel.
#
# Overridable environment:
#   SHEN_SWIFT       - shen-swift checkout (default: sibling ../shen-swift)
#   SHEN_SWIFT_BIN   - the shen-swift binary (default: built from $SHEN_SWIFT)
